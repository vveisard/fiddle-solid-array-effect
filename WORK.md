STORY createMapArrayEffect
STORY createMapArrayResultEffect
idk what this looks like

EPIC standalone package @vveisard/solid-array-primitives

STORY as a user, I want GitHub versioned releases, so that I can install packages as tarballs

STORY as a user, I want tests

STORY as a developer, I want better effect, mount, and cleanup function types
the call signatures of these functions should match the solid-js API. ie, match `Next` and `Prev` types

STORY as a developer, I want Indexed Element and Indexed Entry functions
Like mapped functions, but uses indexArray
